This Enemy AI script uses the AI Navigation package, specifically the NavMeshAgent component to function. 

I made this because I couldn't find any good scripts online, so I made one myself. I'm open-sourcing this because I want to help other game devs working on their FPS or RPG too!

Star this if you liked this project!
